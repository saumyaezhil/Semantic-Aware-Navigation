# Semantic class cost assignments
# Cost values range from 0 (free) to 254 (lethal)
# 255 is reserved for unknown space

semantic_costs:
  # Navigable surfaces
  road: 0           # Preferred - roads are safe
  sidewalk: 10      # Acceptable
  
  # Semi-navigable
  grass: 50         # Discouraged but possible
  dirt: 40          # Slightly better than grass
  
  # Obstacles
  building: 254     # Lethal
  wall: 254         # Lethal
  fence: 254        # Lethal
  
  # Dynamic/sensitive objects
  person: 200       # Very high cost - avoid humans
  vehicle: 180      # High cost - avoid vehicles
  bicycle: 150      # Moderate-high cost
  
  # Natural obstacles
  tree: 254         # Lethal
  bush: 150         # High cost
  
  # Default
  unknown: 128      # Medium cost for unknown classes
